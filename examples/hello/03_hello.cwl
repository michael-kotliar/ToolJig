  This simple example tool says hello to a person by name. This example is identical to hello2.cwl, except that the tool is executed within a container environment. We use a container image pulled from Docker Hub that consists of the "buster" release (version 10.3) of the Debian Linux operating system. It is a "slim" version of the operating system, meaning that it provides only essential components.
